# P01 Shopping Cart

## Overview

In this project, we implement a simple version of a Shopping Cart using Java Arrays to manage a collection of data efficiently. The project focuses on utilizing arrays, including perfect size and oversize arrays, as a foundational data storage structure in Java. This serves as an exercise in reviewing array usage and managing collections of data, which are critical skills in computer science and software development.

### Project Description

The Shopping Cart project simulates a real-world shopping cart where items can be added to and removed from the cart, and the cart's total value can be calculated, including tax. It uses Java arrays to represent the shopping cart and a catalog of market items, employing procedural programming practices with static methods for the cart operations.

Key functionalities of the Shopping Cart application include:

- **Item Management**: Ability to lookup items by name or identifier in the market catalog and retrieve item prices.
- **Cart Operations**: Adding and removing items from the shopping cart, checking the cart's contents, and calculating the total cost including tax.
- **Data Handling**: Managing a non-ordered collection of data (a bag) which may contain duplicates, emphasizing the handling of arrays within methods.

### Learning Objectives

- Review the use of procedure-oriented code and control structures in Java.
- Practice implementing and managing collections of data using arrays.
- Understand how to approach algorithm development and testing to ensure functionality.

### Additional Requirements

The project adheres to specific requirements, including no pair programming, restrictions on import statements, and specific guidelines for class and method documentation following the JavaDoc standard. It emphasizes individual work, proper use of static methods, and thorough testing to validate functionality against specified behaviors.

This project not only reinforces array manipulation and procedural programming concepts but also prepares students for more advanced data structure management and software development practices.
