# P02 Water Fountain

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a graphical implementation of a particle system, using small images or shapes to simulate the appearance of amorphous objects like water. The interface utilizes the Java Processing graphic library to create an interactive graphical application that responds to mouse and keyboard input.

### Learning Objectives

- Learn to create and use objects within a graphical setting.
- Develop an understanding of interactive graphical application development.
- Gain experience with callback methods to handle user interactions such as mouse clicks and key presses.

### Project Requirements

- Individual work is emphasized; pair programming is not allowed.
- The project restricts import statements to essentials such as `java.util.Random`, `java.io.File`, and `processing.core.PImage`.
- Students will engage with the Java Processing library for graphical application development, requiring careful attention to the specification and clarity in instructions.
- The application relies on callback methods (`setup`, `draw`, `mousePressed`, `keyPressed`) to manage its lifecycle and respond to user interactions.
- The program's GUI involves dynamic elements like droplets to simulate a water fountain, with interactions allowing for manipulation of the fountain's position and the generation of new droplets.

### Key Features

- The application displays a water fountain graphic with dynamically generated droplets that simulate the flow of water.
- Users can interact with the fountain, moving its position with mouse clicks or generating screenshots with keyboard inputs.
- The project introduces students to the basics of animation within a graphical user interface, focusing on the management of multiple moving objects.

### Technical Highlights

- Utilization of the Processing library for drawing and managing graphical elements.
- Implementation of procedural programming techniques, including the use of static methods and callback functions for event handling.
- Management of object arrays for simulating particle systems, with methods to update, create, remove, and move particles based on user input and predefined behaviors.
