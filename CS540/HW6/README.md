# Neural Network Implementation with Pytorch for Fashion-MNIST Classification

## Overview

This project involves implementing and training a basic neural network using the Pytorch framework. The objective is to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which includes 10 classes of clothing items. This assignment serves as an introduction to setting up Python virtual environments, utilizing Pytorch for deep learning tasks, and familiarizing oneself with the workflow of building, training, and evaluating neural network models.

## Goals

- Set up a Python virtual environment and install Pytorch.
- Familiarize with Pytorch's data loading, model building, training, and evaluation utilities.
- Implement a neural network to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
- Train the model and evaluate its performance on a test dataset.
- Predict labels for individual images and understand the model's decision-making process.
