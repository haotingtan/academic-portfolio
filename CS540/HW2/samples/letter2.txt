We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno, but
It was my wedding day (it was our wedding day)
We were getting ready, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky (no clouds allowed in the sky)
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin (thunder)
You telling this story, or am I?
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on
Bruno says, "It looks like rain" (why did he tell us?)
In doing so, he floods my brain
Abuela, get the umbrellas
Married in a hurricane
What a joyous day! But anyway
