# Facial Analysis Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Project Description

This project is an exploration of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a statistical procedure that utilizes an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The implementation focuses on facial analysis using the Yale face dataset. The project is executed in Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for computation and visualization.

## Goals

- To understand and apply PCA in the context of image data for facial analysis.
- To gain proficiency in Python for scientific computing.
- To create visual representations of original and PCA-projected facial images.

## Libraries Required

- Python 3
- NumPy
- SciPy (version >= 1.5.0)
- Matplotlib

## Dataset

The project utilizes the Yale face dataset, specifically a processed subset provided in the file `YaleB_32x32.npy`. This dataset includes 2414 images, each with a resolution of 32x32 pixels.
