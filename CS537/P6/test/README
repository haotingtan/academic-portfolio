To run the tests:

There are currently 6 different test cases available in ~cs537-1/tests/P6.
Each of these folders has an input and output file.

Run the following command 
cp -r ~cs537-1/tests/P6/* . 
to copy all the tests to your working directory

Then run your psort with the provided input file, and run rcheck to find the number of mismatches. The rcheck binary is also present in the ~cs537-1/tests/P6 folder, so once it is copied over, you can use this command to run it:
rcheck <your output file> <test output file>

For performance, we will just be checking that a speedup is observed as more threads are added.
